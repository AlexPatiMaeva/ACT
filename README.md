# READ.ME
This repository contains the implementation of the computation of Hartree-Fock (HF) and MP2 energies for closed-shell systems using data provided in TREXIO files.

## Project Description
This project computes the Hartree-Fock energy and MP2 correlation energy for a closed-shell
system using data
provided in a TREXIO file format. It includes a detailed implementation of the Hartree-Fock and MP2
equations
and demonstrates how to work with TREXIO for handling molecular orbital data.
